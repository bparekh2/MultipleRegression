-About Polynomial regression in Statical Analysis Perspective
	In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x 
	and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between 
	the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x). Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model 
	to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the 
	unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of 
	multiple linear regression.
